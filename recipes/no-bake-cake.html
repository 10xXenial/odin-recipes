    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        his cake is creamy, almost like a cheesecake texture. It is very rich and decadent.

When the bananas are mixed with the melted chocolate, it prevents the chocolate from turning back into its solid form. Instead, the chocolate stays in a semi-solid state. So you end up with a rich, fudgy cake that is similar to a flourless chocolate cake.
